# Digital Clock

This project is a simple digital clock that displays the current time with a picture background. The clock updates every second to show the current hours, minutes, and seconds in a 12-hour format with AM/PM notation.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The HTML file that sets up the structure of the clock.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that styles the clock and the background.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that contains the logic to update the clock every second.

## Usage

To view the digital clock:

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Ensure the `backgroundpic.jpg` is in the same directory as the `index.html` file.
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
